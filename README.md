# CDSE computational advertising seminar

Machine learning for profit: Machine learning problems in computational advertising
Online advertising is a multibillion-dollar industry that spans several subfields of computer science and engineering including information retrieval, machine learning, auction theory, optimization and distributed computing.  The class will present an overview of the computational advertising landscape and outline key challenges and discuss how machine learning addresses them. We will analyze some concrete machine learning problems, discuss the algorithms involved and apply them to sample datasets. The problems include (a) value estimation using generalized linear models, (b) topic modeling using LDA. The class will consist of demos and hands-on exercises where we will Vowpal Wabbit and Spark ML libraries to implement these on large-scale datasets. 

This seminar consists of four parts
* [Computational advertisting landscape](advertising-landscape.pdf)
* [Vowpal Wabbit: Scalable Machine learning library](vw.pdf)
* [Value estimation using generalized linear models](value-estimation.pdf)
* [Topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet allocation](lda.pdf)
